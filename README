First (and feeble) attempt to implement the given test. I used several youtube channels and sites.

The first part was to create an array find statistic values and with the help of JUnit5 test to see
if it works properly. The second part is identical to the first except for the data type which is supposed
to be examined ,was an ArrayList in Java. I used negative values,zero values to check if it works properly,
it works somehow against all odds. The third part is a simplified and not so efficient implementation
of sliding window technique.whose test I did not complete.I gained a lot of knowledge,
thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this.
